Argument in a nutshell:
- Financial wellbeing is important
- Emergency savings and spending behaviour are key contributors to it
- Both are understudied
- Behavioural science can help understand them and suggest remedies
- Data and fintech are crucial enablers in performing that reserach and
implementing its solutions on a large scale
- My thesis is an attempt in that direction: use large scale txn data to
understand how people save and spend money, test whether fintech apps can have
effect.
