%There shall be a summary or abstract of the thesis, which should not exceed 300 words, bound in after the acknowledgements and declaration. The summary should not extend beyond a single A4 side, and to facilitate this, single spaced typing is permitted for the summary only. The summary shall provide a synopsis of the thesis and shall state clearly the nature and scope of the research undertaken and of the contribution made to the knowledge of the subject treated. There should be a brief statement of the method of investigation where appropriate, an outline of the major divisions or principal arguments of the work and a summary of any conclusions reached.

Argument in a nutshell:
- Financial wellbeing is important
- Emergency savings and spending behaviour are key contributors to it
- Both are understudied
- Behavioural science can help understand them and suggest remedies
- Data and fintech are crucial enablers in performing that reserach and
implementing its solutions on a large scale
- My thesis is an attempt in that direction: use large scale txn data to
understand how people save and spend money, test whether fintech apps can have
effect.

The overall aim of this thesis is to combine financial transaction data with
insights from behavioural science to make a contribution to the study of how
individuals spend money and save for the short term.

To this aim, the thesis consists of three independent resarch studies that each
focus on a different aspect.
