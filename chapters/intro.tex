\label{cha:introduction}

The overall aim of this thesis is to use transaction-level data from a
financial aggregator app, insights from behavioural science, and methods from
econometrics and machine learning to contribute to a better understanding of
the determinants of how individuals spend their money and save for the
short-term. This introductory chapter first discusses the context within which
this research takes place, and then introduces the main chapters of the thesis.
