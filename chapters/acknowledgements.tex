Warwich Business School has made this project possible by funding it through one of its generous scholarships.\\

\noindent Redzo Mujcic, Zvi Safra, and Ivo Vlaev have provided encourating and critical comments along the way.\\

\noindent Neil Steward has been a tremendous supervisor. His insights and ideas have
helped me move forward when I felt stuck, and his unfailing good humour and
enthusiasm have cheered me up in moments of frustration.
