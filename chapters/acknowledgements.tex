Warwick Business School has paid for this last part -- I'd think! --
of my formal education through one of its scholarhips. Without that generous
support, this endeavour would not have been viable.

Neil Steward has been a tremendous supervisor. His insights and ideas have
helped me move forward when I felt stuck, and his unfailing good humour and
enthusiasm have cheered me up in moments of frustration.

Ma and Pa have supported me in every possible way. Their belief in me is
something to live up to.

Molly has kept me sane through all of this.
