I am grateful to Warwick Business School for making this project possible by funding it through one of its generous scholarships.\\

\noindent I thank Redzo Mujcic, Zvi Safra, and Ivo Vlaev for providing encouraging, critical, and insightful comments that have made the work stronger.\\

\noindent Neil Steward has been a tremendous supervisor! His insights and ideas have
helped me move forward when I felt stuck, and his unfailing good humour and
enthusiasm have cheered me up in moments of frustration.
