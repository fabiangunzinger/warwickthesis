%% Entropy
There is a lot more work to be done in characterising spending profiles. From
entropy paper: There are a number of alternative ways to characterise spend
profiles. We could calculate profiles based on the distribution of transaction
values rather than counts. We could also calculate profiles based on
inter-temporal rather than intra-temporal distributions, focusing on
consistency of purchasing behaviour over time rather than on predictability at
any given time \citep{krumme2013predictability}. Further, we could focus on
time-based rather than category-based measures, focusing, for instance, on
whether purchases of the same type tend to occur on the same day of the week
\citep{guidotti2015behavioral}. Finally, one could also create composite
measures based on principal component analysis, an approach used in
\citet{eagle2010network}. We leave these extensions for future research.
