% From Lara
The two applied studies presented in Chapters 1 and 2 are purely exploratory.
A natural next step to exploring their generalisability is a pre-registered repli- cation on new data (Van den Akker et al., 2019). We did not pre-register any studies presented here since many analysis decisions were taken conditional on the data observed. It is a well-known problem that such data-dependent deci- sions can affect the conclusions drawn from the research (Simmons, Nelson, and Simonsohn, 2011; Gelman and Loken, 2014). The studies are thus a useful first step in exploring the questions of ethnic bias and domestic abuse and will require further, pre-registered analyses.
